Create a weight converter GUI with Python

Standard weight conversion

    1. 1 milligram = 0.001 gram
    2. 1 centigram = 0.01 gram
    3. 1 decigram = 0.1 gram
    4. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
    5. 1 gram = 1000 milligrams
    6. 1 ton = 2000 pounds
    7. 1 pound = 16 ounces

To create a music player with Python, we will be using the Pygame sound component. Then we create functions like play, stop, pause and resume so that we can control the music player. To create these commands, let's create some functions and use Tkinter to create the button on the frontend. Now you have your own music player and you can listen to songs with this app. Also, I think creating apps like a music player or other apps that you can use in your daily life can really help you to explore new Python frameworks while learning more about programming. This is one of the best ways to improve your programming skills by creating something or automating a process that will give you more confidence in programming skills and will be very useful for expanding your portfolio.
